              As a former project manager — now on my way to becoming a web and
              software developer — with four years of experience managing
              diverse types of projects for clients from various industries, I
              combined my newly acquired knowledge with experiences in managing
              problems with a systematic mindset, an eye on small details and a
              touch of creativity.
